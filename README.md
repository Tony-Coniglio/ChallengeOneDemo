# ChallengeOneDemo

In this Challenge I have made the following edits to the starter code. The following changes were made:

1. Changed certain elements to semantic HTML elements
2. Reviewed and optimized the structure of the HTML elements
3. Added accessable Alt atrributes to images and Icons
4. Put the heading attributes in sequential order
5. Changed the title element to be concise and descriptive

Once the changes were made I pushed the edited starter code to my Github account and submitted the project to bootcampspot for review by the graders.
